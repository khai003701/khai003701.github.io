<h3 id="section1" class="h3">About the Author</h3>
<p class="p">
    The macho world of Grand Prix racing has seen radical changes in the last 40 years. 
	Many of these involve medical and safety advancements. 
	The man leading those advancements - a champion in his own right although he has never started a race - is the neurosurgeon Sid Watkins, the house doctor of Formula One. 
	He was involved in the betterment of safety in F1 from 1978 up until 2010 and is still one of the best-loved figures in the sport to this day. 
	He has also bore witness to some of the most spectacular and sometimes fatal crashes in the sport. 
	His account of such accidents is made even more pitiful by the sole fact that some of the men he attempted to heroically save from untimely demise, sometimes at the time of death, had not been just any other competitor, but very close friends of his.

<h3 id="section2" class="h3">Review of "Life at The Limit"</h3>
<p class="p">
	A very intriguing look into the fight to progress the safety in Formula One. The stories he knows of and shares are what most fans certainly would enjoy.
	It covers a time in the history of F1 where every race the drivers enter fully knowing they might not start the next one, and where there was no shortage of on track fatalities.
	Written in a very laid back style that skirts the edges of formality and professionalism, it's a rare chance to get to know the F1 of decades past, when it was considered glorified suicide.
	It becoming a sport where there are no casualties in the last few decades is a testament to his contributions, and certainly this has the raw, unfiltered, unedited journey to eventual safety.
	This book inspired me to study more of Grand Prix racing history and evoked bittersweet remembrance of years past, when everything was different and meaner.
	All and all the book leaves the mark of a great piece written by an equally amazing person.

<p class="p">
	The book is written in the same relaxed paddock chatter style found in the previos book of his. Although it would help massively to be familiar with Formula One prior to reading it, I don't think it's truly necessary though. 
	It gives an unique insight into the fight to reduce the evergrowinng risks of racing, from the man that had to endure the most of it. 
	Prof. Sid Watkins (now tragically deceased after a heart attack in 2012) 
	recounts his years of being at the bleeding edge of safety innovation and medical advancements in Grand Prix racing with a writing style of his own along with many informative tidbits inside the world of Formula One racing,
	from the creation of the rule that allowed the medical car to follow the cars during the first lap in case of rather common first lap incidents

	to the infighting that went on amongst the drivers and organizers to create such a rule.
	It does feel a bit disoriented and unconnected at times though, it could've used some more editing and proofreading, but his enthusiasm peeks through regardless.
	The book is certainly worth the time, though the appendices might appear to be slightly exhaustive, similar to those in his first book.
	Without people like Professor Watkins, and Sir Jackie Stewart, who pushed for the safety equipment and the medical advancements to save the lives of those on and off track, who knows how many more could've ended up in the graveyard.
