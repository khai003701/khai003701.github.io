				Theodore John Kaczynski, Ph.D. (a.k.a. Ted Kaczynski) has focused his life’s work on sounding the alarm about society’s paramount problem: the omnipresent, subjugating, and destructive force of technological progress. His extensive writings articulate a comprehensive critique of the global “techno-industrial system” and forecast its catastrophic consequences for humankind and the biosphere. His recent works focus on realistic strategies for collective action to alter the current trajectory of society, and avoid unmitigated disaster.
				<br>
				<br>
				Dr. Kaczynski was born in 1942 in Evergreen Park, Illinois. An intellectual prodigy, he attended Harvard at age 16, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Michigan at 24, and became the youngest professor of mathematics in the history of UC-Berkeley at 25. After two years, Dr. Kaczynski resigned his professorship and moved to a remote wilderness area of western Montana to pursue a life-long ambition of living an autonomous and self-sufficient life off the land, which he did for twenty-five years.
				<br>
				<br>
				Kaczynski has been incarcerated since 1998 in solitary confinement at Federal Prison ADX in Florence, Colorado, after receiving a life sentence for a long-term violent campaign he staged to call world-wide attention to the colossal dangers inherent in technological growth.

		The Review
		</h4>
			<p class="p">
				A complete edition of Industrial Society and Its Future and The System’s Neatest Trick, with additional writings from Ted that expand upon them.
				<br>
				<br>
				He observes that modern technology has driven society away from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle humans find meaningful and interesting. He views technology as a conscious entity that is altering not only our surroundings, but our lifestyle as well.
				<br>
				<br>
				This is directly caused by inaccessibility to what he dubs "the power process". It refers to the desire to try to do and get what they want, from start to finish. Nowadays it's taken over by learning to do things the "right" way, approaching a problem with a predetermined, often fixed solution. The individual can no longer experiment different approaches to the same old problems: they just learn how to do it the "right" way, then do it until their deaths. This is an incredibly agonizing and miserable way of life.
				<br>
				<br>
				Kaczynski sees the effects of any new technology as unregulatable: if it improves efficiency, everyone will want and find a way to do it. Therefore the only solution is to destroy all technological advancements made throughout the course of history.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then follows an analysis of the means to destroying the entirety of technology. He acknowledges that these proposed reforms would cause a mass extinction of humanity due to our dependence on technology for affordable manufacturing and fabrication of resources at present and future population levels. He explicitly states that no life is better than an insufferable life. He believes that life is insufferable to all but few; we just haven't accepted it yet.
				<br>
				<br>
				As a person who was born into, raised by and grown up admiring modern technology, this book forever changed the way I see our modern world. This book will destroy any type of technophilia and joyful positive "great new tomorrow" technological progress idealism you've had in the past. Sure he murdered people, but does that devalue his arguments at all, if any? We cannot ignore his predictions of future society. Technology is slowly gaining complete control over humanity from the inside out.
