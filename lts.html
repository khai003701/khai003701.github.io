		In 2009, BlackBerry controlled half of the smartphone market. Today that number is zero. What went so wrong?

Losing the Signal is a riveting story of a company that toppled global giants before succumbing to the ruthlessly competitive forces of Silicon Valley. This is not a conventional tale of modern business failure by fraud and greed. The rise and fall of BlackBerry reveals the dangerous speed at which innovators race along the information superhighway.

With unprecedented access to key players, senior executives, directors and competitors, Losing the Signal unveils the remarkable rise of a company that started above a bagel store in Ontario. At the heart of the story is an unlikely partnership between a visionary engineer, Mike Lazaridis, and an abrasive Harvard Business school grad, Jim Balsillie. Together, they engineered a pioneering pocket email device that became the tool of choice for presidents and CEOs. The partnership enjoyed only a brief moment on top of the world, however. At the very moment BlackBerry was ranked the world's fastest growing company internal feuds and chaotic growth crippled the company as it faced its gravest test: Apple and Google's entry in to mobile phones.

Expertly told by acclaimed journalists, Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff, this is an entertaining, whirlwind narrative that goes behind the scenes to reveal one of the most compelling business stories of the new century.

		This book documents the meteoric rise and fall of RIM/BlackBerry.
		RIM pioneered mobile communication and created a stranglehold on the smartphone market in 10 years only to lose it all in 5.
		The authors gained access to many of those involved and acquired a never before seen perspective.
		How the 2 founders came into contact and subsequently partnered was very well detailed as you realize how important each little event leading up to their long lasting partnership is. 
		Only one wrong move and there would be no BlackBerry.
		The downfall of BB is a common tale in the world of telecommunications (as with Nokia and others), but 'Losing the Signal' offers a new, more personal explanaton: 
		how the founders' genius and strengths ultimately became their biggest weakness.
		The book has multiple reasons for the decline. Many of them were quite obvious to those closely following the company.
		The founders were unable to accept that they have to to hand over the reigns to experienced heads in order to grow and mature the company. 
		They kept holding on to what was now a shell of its former glory as they desperately try to catch up to the current market leaders with their obsolete style of management.
		There was much more political turmoil inside the company than what was known at the time.
		An untold power struggle between the CEOs and shareholders and the rest of the company (management, engineers,...) was mentioned more than once as an example.
		There is however one small complaint, which is the lack of coverage on the reforms of the new owners that came after the original duo. 
		They have brought the company back from the verge of bankruptcy to industry-leading in multiple embedded software fields.
		From a longtime BB fan perspective this book gave a lot more insight compared to what was known publicly. Well worth it. Wish John Chen good luck in his rebuilding efforts.
