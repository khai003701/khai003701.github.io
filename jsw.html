		In "A History of Central Banking and the Enslavement of Mankind",
		ex-South African banker Stephen Goodson explains how the Central Banking "scam" originated,
		and how those who run it have throughout history used their power to subvert governments,
		and manufacture wars that not only produced vast profits, but frequently to topple 'regimes' whose banking system was not under their control.
		<br>
		The 'scam' of the money-lenders is the ability to literally create money from nothing, and then lend and accumulate interest on "credit,"
		and then re-lend that interest for further interest, in perpetuity, that creates pervasive, worldwide debt, from the individual, to the family, to the entire state.
		<br>
		The cultural and material progress of a civilization will often relate to the degree by which it is free from the influence of debt,
		and the degradation that results when the money-lenders are permitted to abuse their power. Hence, Goodson shows that both World Wars,
		the Napoleonic wars, the American Revolution, the rise and fall of Julius Caesar, the regicide of Charles I of England, 
		the overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya and the revolution against Tsar Nicholas, among much else in history relate to this "Hidden Hand".

		This book gives an eye-opening insight into how private bankers have always exploited the stranglehold they possess on the economy to induce massive debt on the individual.
		They have the ability to create money on demand from nothing, 
		lend and accumulate interest on "credit" from this fabricated money, in turn creating nigh-infinite wealth for themselves through the power of compound interest, 
		sometimes with such exorbitant rates that the lendee, no matter their position, wealth and power, would almost always be crippled with debt.
		<br>
		Ever since the introduction of currency in trading, the money lenders have tried (and succeeded) in persuading governments that banking is best left to private interests, alleviating the fear of government monitoring and regulation of their practices. 
		Still, to this day, the monetary policy is set independently of the government's will.
		In various times throughout history, where several nations flourished in the absence of usury and perpetual, pervasive debt, those in charge of such banking conglomerates have used their power to destabilize
		and ultimately destroy them at all costs. In 2000 there were 7 countries without a Rothschild owned or controlled Central Bank: Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, Iran.
		Only Iran, North Korea, and Cuba remain.

		The Hidden Origins of the Bank of England
		...all great events have been distorted, most of the important causes concealedâ€¦ If the history of England is ever written by one who has the knowledge and the courage, 
		the world would be astonished. - Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of Great Britain

		Stephen Goodson is no stranger to the elite banking scene; for many years he held the position of non-executive director of the South African Reserve Bank. His personal views are quite questionable, 
		and one could draw to the conclusion that his integrity and stance on this matter has been warped by his own internal bias.
		But his decade-long research, his meticulous attention to detail, and his conclusions hold up relatively well.
