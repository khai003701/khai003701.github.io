				Theodore John Kaczynski, Ph.D. (a.k.a. Ted Kaczynski) has focused his life’s work on sounding the alarm about society’s paramount problem: the omnipresent, subjugating, and destructive force of technological progress. His extensive writings articulate a comprehensive critique of the global “techno-industrial system” and forecast its catastrophic consequences for humankind and the biosphere. His recent works focus on realistic strategies for collective action to alter the current trajectory of society, and avoid unmitigated disaster.
				<br>
				<br>
				Dr. Kaczynski was born in 1942 in Evergreen Park, Illinois. An intellectual prodigy, he attended Harvard at age 16, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Michigan at 24, and became the youngest professor of mathematics in the history of UC-Berkeley at 25. After two years, Dr. Kaczynski resigned his professorship and moved to a remote wilderness area of western Montana to pursue a life-long ambition of living an autonomous and self-sufficient life off the land, which he did for twenty-five years.
				<br>
				<br>
				Kaczynski has been incarcerated since 1998 in solitary confinement at Federal Prison ADX in Florence, Colorado, after receiving a life sentence for a long-term violent campaign he staged to call world-wide attention to the colossal dangers inherent in technological growth.

		Now on to the review......
		</h4>
			<p class="p">
			Ted Kaczynski's Unabomber Manifesto could possibly be one of the strangest documents of today. From the pinnacle of achievement and intellect, boasting a shocking IQ of 167 and having been educated at Harvard, and professed at Berkley, over time Kaczynski degenerated into the personification of paranoia and this manuscript, is what 20 years alone in the woods has done to a mathematician-turned-domestic-terrorist.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the first chapters of the manifesto, he proposes the theory that feelings of inferiority amid depression, anxiety and numerous other problems are directly attributable to the adverse effects of what he calls the "power process". A convincing argument that this "power process" can often be directly linked to playing a part in ensuring the survival and growth of the industrial and technologically dependent society of today is made. Advanced industrialized societies cannot exist without extremely large pyramid hierarchies which inevitably leaves the majority stuck at the bottom and powerless.
			<br>
			<br>
			To fully understand the core points throughout this manifesto regarding the effects of the "power process", examples must be used. One of the best is the current choices of employment for the lower working class. Workplaces in modern society are increasingly repetitious (e.g. data manipulation, production, fabrication) and governed by a few at the top of the pecking order who give nothing but orders and quotas. Those who wish to secure their jobs are forced to do what they're told with very little to no freedom or power. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In the later parts of the manifesto, a revolution to completely destroy the perceived "system" is proposed. However, after extensive reading I think of his proposed ideas for a "revolution" as much less of one and more of a reform; he advocates a complete reversal of the Industrial Revolution and a return to anarcho-primitivism and the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our ancestors. This however, suggests that his "revolution" does not eliminate the chance of the human race slowly forming communities, colonies, and societies as time goes on, effectively undoing what the manifesto advocates with time and bringing us back to the dystopian industrial society of present.
			<br>
			<br>
			There is also a major flaw in his analysis: he chose to analyze technology as a whole instead of technology in developed society (in other words, capitalism). He thinks that technology is some ultimate force of power as he even proposes the restriction of its role and development in his visions for an ideal society despite the fact that this contradicts his own principles on predicting the growth of society. Much of this could be avoided by viewing technology as a medium of experience, contributing and sustaining our underlying social system structure as much as anything else.
			<br>
			<br>
			This is not the type of book to be read once and forgotten; it should be discussed among open-minded and similar members of society. I disagree with some of the arguments about technology and modern leftism, but it's impossible to finish it without acknowledging the legitimacy of his philosophy.

			<p class="p">
			The most interesting thing about Ted is that he didn't kill then write a manifesto to justify those killings, he wrote a manifesto then killed to draw attention to it.
			This, among other things made me believe in the theory that he felt forced to carry out those bombings just so that his manuscript would not drown in what he calls the "information highway" of the public.
			I honestly feel that if Ted was born just 22 years later, none of the bombings would've happened and his text would still garner the attention he felt it needed, ironically thanks to the advent of personal computing and the Internet.
			This is also supported by the Washington Post's publication of the manifesto, which can be found <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm">here</a>.
			This digital publication, along with the word of mouth of many modern-day anarchists online (some of whom I had the pleasure of conversing with) have led me to read and study the manifesto myself, and I'm thankful I did.
			<br>
			<br>
			I hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I did making it. If you have any questions just hit me up through whatever I sent this to you with (or with grades if you're marking this).
