		<h4 class="p">1. Overview</h4>
		<p class="p">
		On a typical British day in 2002, Richard Porter was hired to be the script editor of Top Gear. He would remain in that position until the end of series 22, the last one presented by the old hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May in 2015.
		<br>
		During 13 years of production, they wrecked countless cars, destroyed diplomatic relations (H982 FKL), demolished entire neighbourhoods, and with comedic ingenuity and unrivaled wit, reformed Top Gear from being a dwindling sensible BBC2 car programme full of actually useful information to a record-breaking, globetrotting behemoth.
		<br>
		And on That Bombshell goes behind the scenes of arguably the most successful motoring show in the UK (and probably the world), taking in burning trailers, broken arms, flying cars, falling cars, swimming cars, angry Argentinians and a 6 feet tall orangutan.
		<br>
		Richard Porter gives a director's view into how the episodes were produced, revealing disasters more ridiculous than anything aired and explaining the experience of playing a crucial role in bringing a small poky car show to the TVs of hundreds of millions.

		<h4 class="p">2. Review</h4>
		<p class="p">
		And on that Bombshell is a summary of the golden age of "old Top Gear" stretching over 13 years from 2002 to 2015. As a recent fan of the show, I had to settle with watching the show retroactively, so I really enjoyed this insight. The book was written in a similar style of deadpan humor style as the show was as it dives into the early days of the show and how it got in millions of people's TVs worldwide. I loved the Stig's origins (you can go read his book for more) and how the show managed to put drivers and celebrities in their "reasonably priced car" (this is a cheap new car that changes every once in a while). It also answers whether the presenters are as they are in real life like in the show. About that, they are basically the same, just less exaggerated. My only complaint is that the humor is sometimes too much; in the earlier chapters it assaults you with deliberately humorous quips every third line, sometimes even every second line, with no time for buildup. This awkward pacing usually turns off some people from continuing to read. In the later chapters the quality of the humor progresses in a similar path to the show. It is much more refined, with classier deliveries, more optimal pacing and buildup. To summarize it was a great recap of how Top Gear came to be. A must read for sure if you are a Top Gear fan.
